## Introduction

Steganography is the practice of hiding secret information within a non-secret medium such as an image, audio, or video file. This technique ensures that the existence of the hidden information is concealed, making it an effective method for secure communication.

## Uses of Steganography

- **Confidential communication:** Steganography allows for the secure transmission of sensitive data without arousing suspicion.
- **Digital watermarking:** Used in copyright protection to embed watermarks in digital media.
- **Authentication:** Ensures the authenticity and integrity of the information.
- **Data protection:** Protects data from unauthorized access and tampering.

## Where to Use Steganography

- **Corporate communications:** Securely share sensitive information within a company.
- **Military and intelligence:** Covertly transmit classified information.
- **Digital media:** Embed copyright information in images, audio, and video files.
- **Personal privacy:** Safeguard personal information from prying eyes.
